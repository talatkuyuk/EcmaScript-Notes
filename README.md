# Initial page

I have just finished the **Udacity "ES6 - JavaScript Improved" free course**. \(January 2021\). I decided to take course notes for myself to utilize it later. Since the human brain is so forgetful, this is necessary for me.

I strongly recommend you enroll to Udacity course "ES6 - JavaScript Improved" , since there are good covarage about ES6 with good explanations. It is well-prepared self-paced course.

I assume this document as ES Cheat Sheet for myslef.

I have also read some good articles about EcmaScript. I am going to embed and merge them into this document.
