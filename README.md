# Initial page

I have just finished the **Udacity "ES6 - JavaScript Improved" free course**. \(January 2021\). I decided to take the course notes for myself to utilize it later. Since the human brain is so forgetful, this is necessary for me.

I strongly recommend you enroll to Udacity free course "**ES6 - JavaScript Improved**" , since there is good coverage about ES6 with good explanations and examples. It is self-paced and well-prepared by [@parkesrjames](https://twitter.com/parkesrjames) and [@richardkalehoff](https://twitter.com/richardkalehoff).

I utilize this document as **ECMAScript CHEAT SHEET** for myself.

I have also read some good articles about ECMAScript. I am going to embed and merge them into this document.
