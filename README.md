# Initial page

I have just finished the **Udacity "ES6 - JavaScript Improved" free course**. \(January 2021\). I decided to take the course notes for myself to utilize it later. Since the human brain is so forgetful, this is necessary for me.

I strongly recommend you enroll to Udacity free course "ES6 - JavaScript Improved" , since there is good coverage about ES6 with good explanations and examples. It is well-prepared and self-paced course.

I assume this document as ECMASCRIPT CHEAT SHEET for myslef.

I have also read some good articles about EcmaScript. I am going to embed and merge them into this document.
