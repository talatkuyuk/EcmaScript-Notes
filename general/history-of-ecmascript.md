### How to Know What Features Browsers Support? <a id="how-can-you-know-what-features-browsers-support-"></a>

If you try running any ES6 code in an older browser, it won't work.

With new language specifications coming out every year and with browsers updating every other month, it can be quite challenging to know what browser supports which language features. Each browser maker \(except for Safari\) has a website that tracks its development status. 

* Google Chrome - [https://www.chromestatus.com/features\#ES6](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#ES6)
* Microsoft Edge - [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/?q=ES6](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/?q=ES6)
* Mozilla Firefox - [https://platform-status.mozilla.org/](https://platform-status.mozilla.org/)

> **NOTE:** Safari doesn't have it's own platform status website. Under the hood, though, Safari is powered by the open source browser engine, Webkit. The status for Webkit features can be found [here](https://webkit.org/status/).

This can be a lot of information to track down. If you prefer a birdseye view of all the feature support for all JavaScript code, check out the ECMAScript Compatibility Table built by [@kangax](https://twitter.com/kangax):
