# What is ECMAScript

### ECMAScript, ECMA-262 and JavaScript

**ECMAScript** is a programming language itself, specified in the document ECMA-262. 

In other words, **ECMA-262** is the specification of the programming language ECMAScript.

**JavaScript**, on the other hand, can be viewed as a "dialect" of ECMAScript. _It conforms to the ECMAScript specification while also providing additional features not described in the specification._
