# What is ECMAScript

### ECMAScript ****and JavaScript

_ECMA stands for_ **European Computer Manufacturers Association.** To reflect the global activities of the Europe-based Ecma organization the name was changed in 1994 to: **Ecma International - European association for standardizing information and communication systems,**  the "trademark" "Ecma" was kept for historical reasons.

**ECMAScript** is a programming language itself, specified in the **document** **ECMA-262**. In other words, **ECMA-262** is the specification of the programming language ECMAScript.

**JavaScript**, on the other hand, can be viewed as a **"dialect" of ECMAScript**. _It conforms to the ECMAScript specification while also providing additional features not described in the specification._

The specification \(commonly shortened to "spec"\) for ES6 can be found [here](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html). The spec lists the set of rules and guidelines on how the language is supposed to function. It doesn't give specific details on _how_ browser makers are supposed to achieve functionality, but it does provide step-by-step instructions on how the language is supposed to work.
